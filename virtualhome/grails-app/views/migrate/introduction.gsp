              Over the past few months we've been hard at work on this new version of the AAF Virtual Home.

              You might notice that it looks a bit different but we think you'll find it easier to use. Infact it now works not only on your computer but from all your mobile devices as well.

              We've moved all your existing data across but to ensure your security we need you to set a new password. You'll only need to <strong><em>do this once</em></strong>.
